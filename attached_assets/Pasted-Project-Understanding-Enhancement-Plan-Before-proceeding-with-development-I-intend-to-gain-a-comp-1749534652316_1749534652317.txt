Project Understanding & Enhancement Plan
Before proceeding with development, I intend to gain a comprehensive understanding of the entire project architecture and business logic to ensure all upcoming fixes and feature implementations align with project goals and maintain design consistency.

üõ†Ô∏è Task Breakdown
1. Homepage ‚Äì Replace Text in Circular Pill with Image
On the homepage, there is a circular pill-shaped element containing text.

Replace the text with an image while preserving the original shape and layout.

The image should scale appropriately within the circular boundary without distortion.

2. Homepage ‚Äì Expand Product Details on Card
In the ‚ÄúProduct Range‚Äù section of the homepage, each product card contains a ‚ÄúLearn More‚Äù button.

Instead of navigating to a different product page:

Clicking the button should dynamically expand the same card to display more detailed product information.

The expanded section should smoothly reveal below the existing content within the card (refer to the image provided).

This should be implemented using a toggle or collapsible section with smooth animation for UX consistency.

3. Homepage ‚Äì Certification Section UI Update
The existing certifications UI should be redesigned to match the provided visual (with a centered certification image, cleaner layout, and minimalistic design).

Only update the homepage certification section without affecting other pages.

4. Products Page ‚Äì Remove ‚ÄúLearn More‚Äù Buttons
In the Products page, remove the ‚ÄúLearn More‚Äù button from each product tile.

The additional information is currently not required, and cleaner UI is preferred.

5. Navigation Bug ‚Äì Scroll to Section Behavior
Fix the navigation behavior for all top navigation items (e.g., Home, Our Products, Contact Us).

When clicked, the page should scroll to the top of the corresponding section, not to a middle or incorrect offset.

Ensure smooth scrolling behavior across all browsers and devices.

6. Feature ‚Äì YouTube Popup on Scroll (Homepage & Contact Us)
Implement a scroll-triggered popup feature:

On Home and Contact Us pages only.

When the user scrolls to the bottom of the page, trigger a popup after a 7-second delay.

The popup should embed and auto-play a YouTube video about Ceylon Cinnamon (you may provide the video link).

Ensure this feature appears only once per session to avoid repeat disruptions.
